# A quantum algorithm for solving the Black-Scholes PDE

An implementation of the hybrid Quantum-Classical algorithm to solve the Black-Scholes PDE, based on the paper [A Quantum algorithm for linear PDEs arising in Finance
](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02753)

The simulation was performed using Qiskit, a python library for quantum programming.
